"""MCP transport over fastmcp for backends exposing memory tools as MCP tools.

A thin wrapper around `fastmcp.Client` that calls the backend's `add_memory`
and `search_memory` tools. Unlike the REST transport (one JSON request in,
one JSON body out), MCP tools are invoked by name with argument dicts, and
the per-user tenancy (org/project/user) is passed as tool arguments rather
than embedded in a request body or URL.

A single long-lived `fastmcp.Client` is shared across all calls; tenancy is
carried per-call in the tool arguments, so there is no per-user client churn.
